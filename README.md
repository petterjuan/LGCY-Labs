# LGCY Labs — Next.js App (App Router)

This repository is a small Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind project scaffold for the LGCY Labs landing site.

Quick start
1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

3. Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

Environment variables
Create a `.env.local` (or set on the host) with the following keys as needed:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` — the canonical site URL (e.g. `https://example.com`). Used for metadata and sitemap generation.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID` — optional: Google Analytics Measurement ID (e.g. `G-XXXXXXXX`) to enable the gtag snippet.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT` — optional: an HTTP endpoint (e.g. Formspree) to forward contact submissions. If set, form submissions will be POSTed to this endpoint from the server route. If omitted, submissions are logged on the server (dev friendly).

Contact form
- The client-side contact form (in `sections/Contact.tsx`) POSTs JSON to `/api/contact`.
- The server route `app/api/contact/route.ts` will forward to `NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT` if present, otherwise it logs the submission to the server console and returns success (so you can test locally).

Sitemap & robots
- `/sitemap.xml` is generated by `app/sitemap.xml/route.ts` and uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` when present.
- `/robots.txt` is present in `public/robots.txt` and references `/sitemap.xml`.

Open Graph image
- A placeholder OG image is available at `public/images/og-image.svg`. Replace this with a production asset (1200x630) for best results.

Notes
- This project uses Tailwind CSS. See `tailwind.config.ts` for the theme overrides.
- Client-only libraries (like Framer Motion) are used only inside client components (`"use client"`) to avoid server import issues.
- The `.next` directory is ignored in `.gitignore` and build artifacts should not be committed.

Pull request
- Changes were implemented on the `feat/analytics-sitemap-contact` branch and a PR was opened: https://github.com/petterjuan/LGCY-Labs/pull/1

If you'd like, I can:
- Wire a SendGrid/SES integration for server-side emails.
- Replace the placeholder OG image with a designer asset.
- Add a small CI workflow to build and lint on PRs.
